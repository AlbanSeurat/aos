Small playground bare-metal programming for raspberry pi 3+ (my own)

I have been inspired by https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial and https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspi3-OS-tutorials


## compile and run 

to compile rust programs 
```make```

to run the kernel and programs

```./run.sh```
